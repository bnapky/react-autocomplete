# Test

You will be given a "mock server" (aka a JS file with some functions) that will give you some mock data. From this, you will create a dropdown that will query this server, and display the results to the user. You will also create the filter function that is used on the server side. Get as creative or as simple as you want this this, just keep in mind, the "mock server" has the ability to return anywhere from 1 user to Infinity users, so mess around with that and make sure that with different data counts, the UI still feels fast and functions properly.

We have provided you with a basic webpack/dev server setup. Hopefully this helps expedite the process for you, if it gets in your way, feel free to get rid of it, just make sure to document how we will run/use the new setup.

Included is babel-preset-env which will allow you to use the latest javascript features, if you want to use something that is still in the proposal stages, feel free to add whichever preset you need.

Here are some expectations for the final product that you build. Outside of these, feel free to add features that you think would be nice or any improvements that would better the experience for the end user.

What can I use?

Feel free to use any framework/library/language you feel is necessary. 
You must build the searching/autocomplete functionality and the input/dropdown UI yourself.
Go ahead and use any other libraries/utilities etc that provide additional benefit for you.
What should a user be able to do?

As I type, I should get relevant results based on my input
As I type, the results should have the search match highlighted
Once I get my result, I should be able to select it and have it persist in the input
What other requirements are there?

It should be semi pretty, not everyone is a design legend, but we'd like to see what you can do.
It should be keyboard accessible. Accessibility matters to us and it is something we have to consider when building UI components.
